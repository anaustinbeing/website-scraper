# Webscraper
Scrape any websites in a matter of seconds.
***************

This Webscraping program is written in **Python 2.7.11**. Basically, it scrapes any websites and outputs all the links that it finds. The set of programs that eases this task are called web crawlers or spiderbots or simply spiders. *Pretty cool!*


A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering). - as described in 
[wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler).

Follow the steps below:
* **Clone or download** all .py files.
   Make sure all .py files are in the **same** directory.
* **Run** main.py
* **Type** in the website address which you need to scrape.
   **The program will do the rest for you.**
   
   *Just that simple!*
   
 The output generates two files: crawled.txt and queue.txt
 * **crawled.txt** contains all links that are crawled.
 * **queue.txt** contains all links waiting to be crawled.
